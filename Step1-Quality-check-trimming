## Step 1: Quality assessment and trimming

Documentation on CIRCE/RRA cluster: https://wiki.rc.usf.edu/index.php/Main_Page

### Submit a job to the cluster

Identify the directory containing all your input fastq files. You can go to any directory using the change directory **cd** command followed by the directory name, e.g. **cd folder_name**. To go one level up, e.g. from /work/x/xxx to /work/x, use the **cd ..** command. Always, check the current working directory using the **pwd** command, e.g.

```
cd /work/x/xxx
pwd
```
In your working directory, e.g. /work/x/xxx, make a subfolder for your fastqc output files with the **mkdir** command:

```
cd /work/x/xxx
mkdir fastqc_orig
```

This will create a new folder at **/work/x/xxx/fastqc_orig**.

Modify the bash script template below to automate 1) quality assessment of pre- and post-trimmed fastq files and 2) fastq trimming using a Q25 threshold. These functions are performed using the fastqc and cutadapt packages in TrimGalore!

#### Required modifications: 
1. Change variable **DIR** (line 9 below) to point to your own working directory that contains your fastq files, e.g. if your working directory is /work/a/aaa/fastq instead of /work/x/xxx, change that.
2. If your fastq files have other file extensions, e.g. **.fastq** or **.fq** instead of **.fastq.gz**, change that in line 11 below.
3. Look for patterns in your fastq file names. If your fastq files all end with other suffixes instead of **_R1_001.fastq.gz**, change that in lines 13 and 15 below.
4. Change job name in line 2 from **trim** to something more intuitive to you (optional)
5. Remove lines 4 and 5 if not using RRA partition (optional)

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=trim
#SBATCH --time=5:00:00
#SBATCH --partition=rra
#SBATCH --qos=rra

module add apps/trimgalore/0.4.4

DIR="/work/x/xxx/"

fastqc $DIR/*.fastq.gz -o $DIR/fastqc_orig

for i in `ls $DIR/*R1_001.fastq.gz | sed "s/_R1_001.fastq.gz//g"`
do
trim_galore -q 25 --paired --fastqc --nextera -o $DIR "$i"_R1_001.fastq.gz "$i"_R2_001.fastq.gz
done
```
Save the script as for example, **trim.sh** and change the permission of the file so that it is executable:

```
chmod +x trim.sh
```

Submit the job to the server:

```
sbatch trim.sh
```
Once successful, you will see something like:
```
Submitted batch job 24994320
```

Check job status. Change xxx to your username on the cluster.
```
squeue -u xxx
```
You will see statuses like the ones below. "PD" indicates that the job is pending; "R" indicates that the job is running. If you don't see your job anymore, that most likely means it has finished running.

Pending:

```
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
          24994320       rra     trim  xxx PD       0:00      1 (None)
```

Running:
```
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
          24994320       rra     trim  xxx  R       0:53      1 mdc-1057-24-14
```

Log files of all completed jobs will be saved as **slurm-xxxx.out**. Check your log files and output files once everything is done.

#### Output files:
1. fastqc_orig/zip files - FastQC output in zipped format, not essential, you can remove them
2. fastqc_orig/html files - FastQC output in HTML format. Download and open them to look at a summary of the quality of each fastq files.
3. val_1.fq/val_1.fq.gz files - Trimmed forward fastq files
4. val_2.fq/val_2.fq.gz files - Trimmed reverse fastq files
5. trimming report text files - Summary of trimming proces e.g. how many reads were retained after quality filtering. Move them to a subfolder if you wish
6. fastqc related zip and html files - See points #1 and #2
